# Classification_and_Data_Imbalance:

This project uses a simple Thyroid dataset which is famous for data imbalance. I will first perform the usual steps of Logisitic regression, then followed with other classification algorithms. Then, I will try out different sampling methods in combination with the classification algorithms in order to find out how these combinations deal with data imbalance and which one deals with it the best. This project includes steps such as ***Data Cleaning***, ***Exploratory Data Analysis***, ***Data Modeling***, ***Classification algorithms***, ***Sampling techniques*** and ***Combination of classification models and sampling techniques***, ***Model Evaluation***


## Further, I am listing down steps in each phase here:

* **Data Cleaning:**               Handling Null values, Removing Duplicates, Checking for Data Imbalance, Performing Sanity Checks, Feature Selection & Feature Engineering.

*  **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  Consists of Univariate, Bi-variate and Multivariate Analysis. I have used line, bar, pair, violin, swarm, histogram plots and heat map in this step.

*   **Data Modeling:**             In this step, I have performed operations such as creating Dummy variables, Scaling and train - test split to get the modeling stack ready.

*  **Classification Algorithms**   In this step, I did few checks such as VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) which is used to detect multi collinearity among the independent variables.

*  **Sampling Techniques:**        I have used several Sampling techniques such as SMOTE, ROSE and variants of SMOTE to handle data imbalance.

* **Model Evaluation:**            I have used metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, AUC-ROC Curve to compare the performance of the above models.
